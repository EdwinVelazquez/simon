juliusd stores its user information and the associated speech model in a database.

That means for juliusd to work correclty you need to have _some_ kind of database. juliusd has been successfully tested with MySQL and SQLITE but other databases will most likely work as well.

SQLITE seems to be the most simple solution as it does not need external programs (just a Qt distribution compiled with sqlite support).



MySQL
======
Configure juliusd to use MySQL in the configuration and create the needed database and the tables (just one "User" table for now).

juliusd ships with a create-script "create_mysql.sql" which creates a database "juliusd" and the table "User" for you.




SQLite
======
To use juliusd with SQLite simply specify QSQLite as your Database type and set the "Database:" value to your database file (most commonly *.db).

juliusd ships with a default db file (juliusd.db) which contains an empty "User" table.

This is a collection of scripts we, the simon team, use internally.

They resulted purely out of necessity. Well designed, efficient, easy to use or bug free are all attributes these scripts definitely DO NOT have.

The only reason they are included in this distribution is to give you a general idea of what to do in your own scripts.

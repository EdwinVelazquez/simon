<para>
&kmyapplication; is the main front end for the simon open source speech recognition solution.

It is a simond client and provides a graphical user interface for managing the speech model and the commands. Moreover, simon can execute all sorts of commands based on the input it receives from the server: simond.
</para>

<para>
In contrast to existing commercial offerings, simon provides a unique do-it-yourself approach to speech recognition. Instead of pre-defined, pre-trained speech models, simon does not ship with any model whatsoever. Instead, it provides an easy to use end-user interface to create language and acoustic models from scratch.

The current release can be used to set up command-and-control solutions especially suitable for the disabled. However, because of the amount of training nescessairy, continuous, free dictation is neither supported nor reasonable with current versions of simon.
</para>

<para>
Because of it's architecture, the same version of simon can be used with all languages and dialects. One can even mix languages within one model if nescessairy.

<title>Speech Recognition: Background</title>

<para>
Speech recognition systems take voice input (often from a microphone) and try to translate it into written text. To do that, they rely on statistical representations of human voice. To put it into simple terms: The computer learns how words - or more correctly the sounds that make up those words - sound.

</table>
</para>

<para>
The pronunciation of each words is composed of individual sounds which are seperated by spaces. For example, the word "close" consists of the following sounds:

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>k</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>l</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>ow</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>s</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The acoustic model uses the fact that spoken words are composed of sounds much like written words are composed of letters. Using this knowledge, we can segment words into sounds (represented by the pronunciation) and assemble them back when recognizing. These building blocks are called "phonemes".
</para>

<para>
Because the acoustic model actually represents how you speak the phonemes of the words, trainings material is shared among all words that use the same phonemes.
</para>
<para>
That means if you add the word "clothes" to the language model, your acoustic model already has an idea how the "clo" part is going to sound as they share the same phonemes ("k", "l", "ow") at the beginning.
</para>
<para>
To train the acoustic model (in other words to tell him how you pronounce the phonemes) you have to "train" words from your language model. That means that simon displays a word which you read out loud. Because the word is listed in your vocabulary, simon already knows what phonemes it contains and can thus "learn" from your pronunciation of your word.

<sect2 id="volume">
<title>Volume</title>
<para>It is important that you check your microphone volume before recording any samples.</para>
<para>A simple way to ensure that your microphone is configured correctly is to use an audio editing tool like the free <ulink url="http://audacity.sourceforge.net">Audacity</ulink>.</para>

<para>Open the program and start the recording. Say a few words. Don't yell but don't be so quiet either. Take into account that you should generally use the same volume setting for all your training and for the recognition too. You might speak a little bit louder (unconsiously) when you are upset or at another time of the day so try to raise your voice a little bit to anticipate this. It is much better to have a little quieter samples than to start clipping.</para>

<sect2 id="wordlist_theory">
<title>General</title>
<para>
The vocabulary defines what words the recognition process should recognize. Every word you want to be able to use with simon should be contained in your vocabulary.
</para>
<para>
One entry in the vocabulary defines exactly one "word". In contrast to common use of the word "word", in simon "word" means one unique combination of the following:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Wordname</para><para>(The written word itself)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Terminal</para><para>(Grammatical category; For example: "Noun", "Verb", etc.)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Pronunciation</para><para>(How the word is pronounced; simon accepts any kind of phonetic as long as it does not use special characters or numbers)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

That means that plurals or even different cases are different "words" to simon.
This is an important design decicion to allow more control when using a sophisticated grammar.
</para>

<para>
In general, it is advisable to keep your vocabulary as sleek as possible. The more words, the higher the chance that simon might misunderstand you.

<title>Active Dictionary</title>
<para>The vocabulary used for the recognition is referred to as active dictionary or active vocabulary.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="shadow_dictionary">
<title>Shadow Dictionary</title>
<para>
As said above, the user should keep his vocabulary / dictionary as lean as possible. However, as a word in your vocabulary has to also have information about it's pronunciation, it would also be good to have large dictionary where you could look up the pronunciation and other characteristics of the words.
</para>
<para>
simon provides this functionality. We refer to this large reference dictionary as "shadow dictionary". This shadow dictionary is not created by the user but can be imported from various sources.
</para>
<para>
As simon is a multi-language solution we do not ship shadow dictionaries with simon. However, it is very easy to import them yourself using the import dictionary wizard. This is described in the <link linkend="import_dictionary">Import Dictionary section</link>.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>



<sect2>
<title>Maintaining the Wordlist</title>
<para>
simon provides a "Wordlist" menu which lists the current vocabulary.

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>simons Wordlist</screeninfo>
  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="wordlist.png" format="PNG"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>Per default, only the active vocabulary is shown. Only after you tick the "Include unused Words from the Shadow Lexicon" checkbox the shadow lexicon is also shown.</para>

<para>
Every word states it "recognition rate" which at the moment is just a counter of how often the word has been recorded (alone or together with other words).
</para>
<para>
When this number is only one or zero the word entry is colored red (1: light red; 0: dark red). This is a visual warning. When a word contains a phoneme combination that is not covered by any other word and the word with this unusual phoneme combination is never recorded (recognition rate = 0), the model <emphasis>will</emphasis> fail to compile. However, simon will display an appropriate error message when the compilation of the model fails because of such an issue. In general it is a good idea to record each word at least once or twice (at best when <link linkend="add_word_record">adding the word</link>) to avoid such problems.
</para>
<para>Because the shadow dictionary is not used for the recognition there are of course no trainings samples for words in the shadow dictionary. So don't be alarmed if all the entries in the shadow dictionary are colored dark red - this is perfectly normal.

</para>
<para> All suggestions from the shadow dictionary are listed in the table "Similar words". Per default only exact word matches are shown. However, this can be changed by checking the "Also show non-perfect matches" checkbox below the suggestion table. Using similar words you can quickly deduce the correct pronunciation of the word you are actually trying to add. See <link linkend="manual_transcription">below</link> for details.</para>

<para>
Of course this really depends on your shadow dictionary. If the shadow dictionary does not contain the word you are trying to add, the required fields have to be filled out manually.</para>

<para>
Some dictionaries that can be imported with simon (SPHINX, HTK) to not differentiate between upper and lower case. Suggestions based on those dictionaries will always be uppercase. You are of course free to change these suggestions to the correct case.
</para>

<para>Some dictionaries that can be imported with simon (SPHINX, PLS and HTK) provide no grammatical information at all. These will assign all the words to the terminal "Unknown". You should change this to something appropriate when adding those words.
</para>

<sect4>
<title>Manually Selecting a Terminal</title>
<para>
The terminal of the word is defined as the grammatical category the word belongs to. This might be "Noun", "Verb" or completely new categories like "Command". For more information see the <link linkend="grammar">grammar section</link>.</para>
<para>
The list contains all terminals used in both your active and your shadow lexicon and in your grammar.
</para>
<para>
You can add new terminals to the drop-down menu by using the green plus sign next to it.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="manual_transcription">
<title>Manually Providing the Phonetic Transcription</title>
<para>
The pronunciation is a bit trickier. simon does not need a certain type of phonetics so you are free to use any method as long as it uses only ASCII characters and no numbers. However, if you want to use a shadow dictionary and want to use it to it's full potential you should use the same phonetics as the shadow dictionary.
</para>

<para>
If you don't know how to transcribe a word yourself you can easily use your shadow dictionary to help you with the transcription - even if the word is not listed in it. Let's say we want to add the word "Firefox" (to launch firefox) which is of course not listed in our shadow dictionary.
</para>

<para>
(I imported the English voxforge HTK lexicon available from <ulink url="http://voxforge.org/home/downloads">voxforge</ulink> as a shadow dictionary.)
</para>

<para>
"Firefox" is not listed in our shadow dictionary so we don't get any suggestion at all.

</para>

<para>
However, we know that firefox sounds like "fire" and "fox" put together. So let's just open the wordlist (you can keep the wizard open) by selecting "Wordlist" from your simon main toolbar.
</para>
<para>
Check the "Include unused words from the shadow lexicon" checkbox beneath the list and simon will display both active and shadow dictionary.
</para>
<para>
Use the "Filter"-Box above the list to search for "Fire":

</para>

<para>
We can see, that the word "Fire" is transcribed as "f ay r". Now filter for "fox" instead of "Fire" and we can see that "Fox" is transcribed as "f ao k s". We can assume, that firefox should be transcribed as "f ay r f ao k s".
</para>

<para>
Using this approach of deducing the pronunciation from parts of the word has the distinct advantage that we not only get a high quality transcription but also automatically use the same phoneme set as the other words which were correctly pulled out of the shadow dictionary.
</para>

<para>
We can now enter the pronunciation and change the terminal to something appropriate.

For example: You have the grammar structure "Trigger Command" and have the word "Computer" of the terminal "Trigger" in your wordlist. You then add a new word "Firefox" of the terminal "Command". simon will now automatically prompt you for "Computer Firefox" as it is - according to your grammar - a valid sentence.

If simon is unable to find appropriate sentences using the word (i.e.: No grammar, not enough words in your active lexicon, etc.) it will just prompt you for the word alone.

<title>Importing a Dictionary</title>
<para>
simon provides the functionality to import large dictionaries as a reference. This reference dictionary is called <link linkend="shadow_dictionary">shadow dictionary</link>.
</para>
<para>
When the user <link linkend="add_word">adds a new word</link> to the model, he has to define the following characteristics to define this word:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Wordname</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Terminal</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Phonetic definition</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
These characteristics are taken out of the shadow dictionary if it contains the word in question. A large, high quality shadow dictionary can thus help the user to easily add new words to the model without keeping track of the phoneme set or - in many cases - even let him forget a the phonetic transcription is needed at all.
</para>

<para>
simon is able to import four different types of dictionaries:
<itemizedlist>

<title>Grammar</title>
<para>
The grammar defines which combinations of words are correct.
</para>

<sect2 id="grammar_general">
<title>General</title>
<para>
Let's look at an example: You want to use simon to launch programs and close those windows when you are done. You would like to use the following commands:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>"Computer, Internet" to open a browser</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>"Computer, Mail"</para><para>To open a mail client</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>"Computer, close"</para><para>To close the current window</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
Following english grammar, your vocabulary would contain the following:

<table frame='all'><title>Sample Vocabulary</title>
<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
<colspec colname='c1'/>
<colspec colname='c2'/>

</row>
<row>
  <entry>close</entry>
  <entry>Verb</entry>
</row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>
</para>

<para>
To allow the sentences defined above simon would need the following grammar:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>"Noun Noun" for sentences like "Computer Internet"</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>"Noun Verb" for sentences like "Computer close"</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
While this would work, it would also allow the combinations "Computer Computer", "Internet Computer", "Internet Internet", etc. which are obviously bogus.
To improve the recognition accuracy, we can try to create a grammar that better reflects what we are trying to do with simon.
</para>

<para>
It is important to remember that you define your own "language" when using simon. That means that you are not bound to grammar rules that exist in whatever language you want to use simon with. For a simple command and control use-case it would for example be advisable to invent new grammatical rules to eliminate the differences between different commands imposed by grammatical information not relevant for this use case.
</para>

<para>
In the example above it is for example not relevant that "close" is a verb or that "Computer" and "Internet" are nouns. Instead, why not define them as something that better reflects what we want them to be:

<table frame='all'><title>Improved Sample Vocabulary</title>
<tgroup cols='2' align='left' colsep='1' rowsep='1'>
<colspec colname='c1'/>
<colspec colname='c2'/>

<row>
  <entry>close</entry>

</tgroup>
</table>
</para>

<para>
Now we change the grammar to the following:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>"Trigger Command"</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

This allows all the combinations described above. However, it also limits the possibilities to exactly those three sentences. Especially in larger models a well thought grammar and vocabulary can mean a huge difference in recognition results.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Defining your Grammar</title>
<para> 
simon provides an easy to use text based interface to change the grammar. You can simply list all the allowed sentences (without any punctuation marks, obviously) like described above.

<sect2>
<title>Import a Grammar</title>
<para>Additionally to simply entering your desired grammar sentence by sentence, simon is able to automatically deduce allowed grammar structures by reading plaintext using the Import Grammar wizard.

<para>Say we have a vocabulary like in the general section above:

<para>We want simon to recognize the sentence "Computer Internet!". So we create a simple text file with this content "Computer Internet!" (any punctuation mark would work) and save it as "simongrammar.txt".

  </mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>simon will then read all the given text files (in this case the only given text file is "simongrammar.txt") and look up every single word in both active and shadow dictionary (the definition in the active dictionary has more importance if the word is available in both). It will then replace the word with its terminal.</para>
<para>In our example this would mean that he would find the sentence "Computer Internet". simon would find out that "Computer" is of the terminal "Trigger" and "Internet" of the terminal "Command". Because of this simon would "learn" that "Trigger Command" is a valid sentence and add it to its grammar.</para>
<para>The import automatically segments the input text files by punctuation marks (".", " - ", "!", etc.) so any natural text should work. The importer will automatically merge duplicate sentence structures (even accross different files) and add multiple sentence (all possible combinations) when a word has multiple terminals assigned to it.</para>
<para>The import will ignore sentences where one or more words could not be found in the language model unless you tick the "Also import unknown sentences" checkbox in which case those words are replaced with "Unknown".</para>

<para>Using the Training-module, you can improve your <link linkend="acoustic_model">acoustic model</link>. </para>

<para>
The interface lists all installed trainingstexts in a table consisting of three columns:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Name</para><para>A descriptive name for the text.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Pages</para><para>The number of "pages" the text consists of. Each page represents one recording.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Recognition Rate</para><para>Analogue to the wordlist represents how likely simon will recognize the words. The recognition rate of the trainingstext is the median recognition rate of all the words in the text.</para></listitem>

  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="training.png" format="PNG"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
To improve the acoustic model - and thus the recognition rate - you have to record trainingstexts. This means that simon gets essentially two needed parts: 

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>Samples of your speech</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>Transcriptions of those samples</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The active dictionary is used to transcribe the words (mapping them from the actual word to its phonetic transcription) that make up the text so every word contained in the trainingstext you want to read (train) has to be contained in your active dictionary. simon will warn you if this is not the case and provide you with the possibility to add all the missing words in one go.

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Training: Warning about missing words</screeninfo>
  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="training_warning.png" format="PNG"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
</screenshot>

The procedure is the same as if you would <link linkend="add_word">add a single word</link> but the wizard will prompt you for details and recordings for all the missing words automatically. This procedure can be aborted at any time and simon will provide both a way to add the already completely defined words and to undo all changes done so far. When the user has added all the words he is prompted for (all the words missing) the changes to the active dictionary / vocabulary are saved and the training of the previously selected text starts automatically.
</para>

<sect1 id="commands">
<title>Commands</title>
<para>When simon is active and recognizes something, the recognition result is given to the loaded command plug-ins (in order) for processing.</para>

<para>The command system can be compared with a group of factory workers. Each one of them knows how to perform one task (e.g. "Karl" knows how to start a program and "Joe" knows how to open a folder, etc.). Whenever simon recognizes something it is given to "Karl" who then checks if this instruction is meant for him. If he doesn't know what to do with it, it is handed over to "Joe" and so on. If none of the loaded plugins know how to process the input it is ignored. The order in which the recognition result is given to the individual commands (people) is configurable in the command options (<guimenu>Settings</guimenu> > <guimenuitem>Configure simon</guimenuitem> > <guimenuitem>Actions</guimenuitem>).</para>

    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="configure_actions_1.png" format="PNG"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>
Each plugin can be associated with a "trigger". Usings triggers, the responsibility of each plugin can be easily be divided.
</para>
<para>Using the factory workers abstraction from above it could be compared to stating the name of who you mean to process your request. So instead of "Open my home folder" you say "Joe, open my home folder" and "Joe" (the plugin responsible for opening folders) will instantly know that the request is meant for him.</para>
<para>In practice you could have commands like the executable command "Firefox" to open the popular browser and the place command "Google" to open the web search engine. If you assign the trigger "Start" to the executable plugin and the trigger "Open" to the place command you would have to say "Start Firefox" (instead of just "Firefox" if you don't use a trigger for the executable plugin) and "Open Google" to open the search engine (instead of just "Google").</para>
<para>Triggers are of course no requirement and you can easily use simon without defining any triggers (altough many plugins come with a default trigger of "Computer" set which you would have to remove). But even if you use just on trigger for all your commands (like "Computer" to say "Computer, Firefox" and "Computer, Google" like) it has the advantage of greatly limiting the false-positives.</para>

<para>
Each Command has a name (which will trigger its invokation), an icon and more fields depending on the type of the plugin (see below).
</para>


<sect2 id="executable_commands">

<title>Adjusting the recognition parameters manually</title>

<para>
simon is targeted towards end-users. It's interface is designed to allow even users without any background in speech technology to design their own language and acoustic models by providing reasonable default values for simple uses.
</para>
<para>
In special cases (severe speech impairments for example), special configuration might be needed. This is why the raw configuration files for the recognition are also respected by simon and can of course be modified to suit your needs.

<!-- (OPTIONAL but recommended) This chapter should include all of the silly
(and not-so-silly) newbie questions that fill up your mailbox. This chapter
should be reserved for BRIEF questions and answers! If one question uses more
than a page or so then it should probably be part of the
"Using this Application" chapter instead. You should use links to
cross-reference questions to the parts of your documentation that answer them.
This is also a great place to provide pointers to other FAQ's if your users
must do some complicated configuration on other programs in order for your
application work. -->

kdelibs, or kdebase.
.Hardware requirements like amount of RAM, disk space, graphics card
capabilities, screen resolution, special expansion cards, etc.
.Operating systems the app will run on. If your app is designed only for a
specific OS, (you wrote a graphical LILO configurator for example) put this
information here.
-->

<para>
In order to successfully use &kmyapplication;, you need &kde; 1.1. Foobar.lib is
required in order to support the advanced &kmyapplication; features. &kmyapplication; uses
about 5 megs of memory to run, but this may vary depending on your
platform and configuration.

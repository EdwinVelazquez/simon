msgid "In contrast to existing commercial offerings, simon provides a unique do-it-yourself approach to speech recognition. Instead of pre-defined, pre-trained speech models, simon does not ship with any model whatsoever. Instead, it provides an easy to use end-user interface to create language and acoustic models from scratch. The current release can be used to set up command-and-control solutions especially suitable for the disabled. However, because of the amount of training necessary, continuous, free dictation is neither supported nor reasonable with current versions of simon."

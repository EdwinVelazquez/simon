===

* Adding new application to the simon suite: ssc; The simon sample collector
  is a client to the sscd (see below). It is a streamlined application
  to make collecting a large number of samples as easy as possible. ssc and
  sscd are more likely to be used for research purposes.


sscd
===

* Adding new application to the simon suite: sscd; The simon sample collector
  daemon is the server component to ssc (sse above). ssc and sscd are more

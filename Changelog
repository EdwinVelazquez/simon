simon: 0.3-alpha-2
===========================================================================

Sound stack
===========
* New sound stack based on QtMultimedia
* Allowing the use of multiple devices
* Playback with multiple devices simultaniously
* Volume calibration

Recognition
===========
* Implemented our own level based voice activity detection (configurable)

Protocol
========
* Julius audio streaming has been replaced with our own implementation 
  using RAW PCM data; Recognition interface now only handels standard 
  WAVE files (easier to replace)


SSC / SSCD
==========
* Adding support for multiple audio devices
* Audio device information is added to the database and can be re-
  constructed for any sample at any time
* Making the connection a bit more stable (handling of connection errors)
* New wizard banners

simon
=====
* Welcome wizard
* Handling Greek characters
* Automatic stopping / starting a local simond if configured to do so
* Configure simond from within simon
* New wizard banners

sam
===
* Respecting multiple sound in-/output devices

simond
======
* Option to keep all recognition samples

Calculator
==========
* Adding the option to only output the calculation

Build system
============
* Portaudio is now an optional dependency (if activated the command line 
  Julius works with microphone input)


===========================================================================
simon: 0.3-alpha-1
===========================================================================

Recognition
===========

* simond now sends 10 found sentences from Julius to simon; Also, confidence
scores have been added

* simon can now ignore recognition results beneath a configurable confidence
  threshold

* simon can now display a "did-you-mean...?"-popup if there are more than one 
  possible recognition results

* Improving the recognition

* Improving the creation of the model with multiple GMMs, different model
type and more

* Improving the handling of very, very large models

* Implementing model compilation adapter that avoids a lot of basic errors
during the compilation process

* You can now use static models or adapted base models


simon
=====

* Implementing package based configuration ("Scenarios")

* Implementing a much nicer KDE style welcome page


Vocabulary
========

* Better phoneme segmentation during the import process

* simon can now import lexica to both the active- and the shadowlexicon 
  (selectable during the import process)

* The BOMP can now be imported directly from the internet

* Huge performance improvements in the display of the list

* simon can now automatically create sentences during the special training

* You now don't need to train a word when adding it any more (optional)

* The complete vocabulary can now be cleared with the press of a button

* Words can now be edited

* When words are removed, the user can now move the word to an unused
terminal, or completely remove the word but keep the samples (for a total of 4
deletion modes)


Grammar
=======

* Displaying examples for each sentence

* The text from which to deduce your grammar from can now be entered directly
(instead of just loaded from files)


Training
========

* simon can now import prompts files

* A new "power training" mode speeds up the training process through 
  automatically starting and stopping the recordings

* Implementing "Clear training data"

* Trainingstexts can now be entered instead of just imported from files


Commands
=======

* Multiple command plugin instances can now be loaded at once

* Implementing keyboard

* Implementing calculator

* Implementing filter plugin

* All triggers can now be configured (including e.g. Buttons in other plugins)

* Adding multiple click modes (right click, middle, click, etc.) to the
desktop grid

* Making plugin fonts configurable

* Displaying the complete needed sentence to activate a command in the run
dialog


ksimond
=======

* simon can now be started through the ksimond context menu


simond
=======

* Adding default user


sam
===

* Adding a new application to the simon suite: sam; The simon acoustic
  modeller is targeted towards power users who want to manually tweak
  their model


ssc
===

* Adding new application to the simon suite: ssc; The simon sample collector
  is a client to the sscd (see below). It is a streamlined application
  to make collecting a large number of samples as easy as possible. ssc and
  sscd are more likely to be used for research purposes.


sscd
===

* Adding new application to the simon suite: sscd; The simon sample collector
  daemon is the server component to ssc (sse above). ssc and sscd are more 
  likely to be used for research purposes.

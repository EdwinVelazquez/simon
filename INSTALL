Documentation: INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------



0. Requirements
---------------

To successfully compile simon you need:
qt >= 4.3.3 (4.4.0 recommended)

Linux:
	alsa-dev
	x11-dev
	xtst-dev

Cross plattform:
	portaudio v19
		If you have compiled portaudio without jack support please remove the two lines containing the word "jack" from src/src.pro

		If you are running windows getting portaudio to run can be a bit tricky.
		Here is a quick & dirty (and tested) way:
			1. Download the precompiled portaudio.dll from http://code.google.com/p/portaudiosharp/downloads/detail?name=PortAudio.dll&can=2&q=
			2. Rename it to portaudio_x86.dll and put it in your src/ subdir
			3. Download a portaudio (source) snapshot http://www.portaudio.com/download.html (v19!)
			4. Extract the portaudio.h file from the include/ directory and put it in the folders: Configuration/Firstrun/ and SimonLib/Sound/
			5. Done!


OpenSuse 11: Install libqt4-devel libqt4-sql-sqlite portaudio20-devel libjack-devel and alsa-devel

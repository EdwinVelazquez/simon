Requirements:
-------------------
qt >= 4.3
alsa (only linux)
X11 (only linux)
direct sound (only windows)


Installation:
-------------------
This is a qt4 project so you have to run qmake to get a Makefile.

Run: 
qmake 
to build your Makefile

Then you can run
make
from your project directory to compile the code.

The executable will be called "simon" and should be in ./bin or ./release/bin/.



Troubleshooting:
---------
There are currently some known bugs about qdir.h, qstyleoption.h and qtextstream.h.

If you run into these problems you will see something like this when compiling:

/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:113: error: expected identifier before numeric constant 
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:113: error: expected `}' before numeric constant 
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:113: error: expected unqualified-id before numeric constant 
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:116: error: 'FrameFeature' was not declared in this scope 
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:116: error: template argument 1 is invalid 
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:116: error: invalid type in declaration before ';' token
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:119: error: expected unqualified-id before ')' token
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:120: error: expected unqualified-id before 'const'
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:120: error: expected `)' before 'const'
/usr/include/QtGui/qstyleoption.h:121: error: expected unqualified-id before 'const'
...


This seems to be related to a certain X11/qt combination. (this seems to be fixed in qt4.3)
You can easily work around these problems with this little hack:

Fire up a texteditor and insert these lines:
 qtextstream.h line 39+: 
 #ifdef Status 
 #undef Status 
 #endif 

 qdir.h line 82+: 
 #ifdef Unsorted 
 #undef Unsorted 
 #endif 

 qstyleoption.h line 112+: 
 #ifdef None 
 #undef None 
 #endif 

You'll find these files in /usr/include/qt4/QtCore (qdir, qtextstream) and /usr/include/qt4/QtGui (may vary - these are the paths for gentoo). 

These constants seem to get defined somewhere (probably X11 libs) but I haven't yet been able to track that down...

You can change back the qt sources at any time (of course this will reintroduce the compile errors when compiling simon again).




Have fun!

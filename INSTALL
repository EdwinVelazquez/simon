This is a qt4 project so you have to run qmake to get a Makefile.

This Makefiles differs on Windows and Linux in some respects.
These changes are made automatically by running qmake with the right Makefile for your operating system.

Run: 
qmake src_LINUX.pro
on Linux - or
qmake src_WINDOWS.pro
to build your Makefile

Then you can run
make
from your project directory to compile the code.

The executable will be called "simon" and should be in ./bin or ./release/bin/.


Have fun!

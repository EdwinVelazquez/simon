This is a qt4 project so you have to run qmake to get a Makefile.

This Makefiles differs on Windows and Linux in some respects.
These changes are made automatically by running qmake with the right Makefile for your operating system.

Run: 
qmake src_LINUX.pro
on Linux - or
qmake src_WINDOWS.pro
to build your Makefile

Then you can run
make
from your project directory to compile the code.

IMPORTANT:
---------
If you recieve a wierd error about qstyleoption.h, you have encountered a bug which occurs with a certain combination of qt and X11.
You can, however, work around that bug by replacing every instance of the word "None" in your qstyleoption.h to something different (for example "NoneX").
Now you should be able to complie simon without further hassle.
You can change back you qstyleoption.h after your successful compile.

The executable will be called "simon" and should be in ./bin or ./release/bin/.


Have fun!
